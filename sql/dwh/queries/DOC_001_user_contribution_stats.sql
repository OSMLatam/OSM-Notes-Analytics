-- DOC-001: User Contribution Statistics
-- Shows how many users have made only one contribution and the distribution of users by contribution level
--
-- This query helps identify:
-- - Users with only one contribution (single-contribution users)
-- - Distribution of users by contribution level (1, 2-5, 6-10, 11-50, 51-100, 101-500, 501-1000, 1000+)
-- - Percentage of users in each category
-- - Total users for context

-- Usage Examples
-- ============================================================================

-- Example 1: Get basic count of single-contribution users
-- SELECT COUNT(1) AS users_with_single_contribution
-- FROM (
--   SELECT f.action_dimension_id_user
--   FROM dwh.facts f
--   GROUP BY f.action_dimension_id_user
--   HAVING COUNT(1) = 1
-- ) AS t;

-- Example 2: Get distribution using the view
-- SELECT * FROM dwh.v_user_contribution_distribution;

-- Example 3: Get summary statistics using the function
-- SELECT * FROM dwh.get_user_contribution_summary();

-- Example 4: Get detailed breakdown
-- Run the "Enhanced Query: Distribution of users by contribution level" query above
