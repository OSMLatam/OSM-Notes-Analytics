-- Export closed notes by country to CSV
-- This query exports closed notes with all relevant information for AI context
-- Comments are cleaned: multiple lines converted to spaces, quotes normalized,
-- length limited
--
-- Author: Andres Gomez (AngocA)
-- Version: 2026-01-17
--
-- Performance optimizations:
-- - Eliminated correlated subqueries using aggregations and window functions
-- - Removed duplicate logic for finding latest close
-- - Optimized JOINs with FDW tables using LATERAL JOINs
-- - Pre-aggregated comment counts and reopen status
--
-- Column order optimized for AI context:
-- 1. Basic info: note_id, country, location, dates
-- 2. Problem: opening_comment (what was reported)
-- 3. Solution: closing_comment (how it was resolved), who closed it
-- 4. Context: resolution time, comment count, reopen status
--
-- Columns exported:
-- - note_id: OSM note ID
-- - country_name: Country name
-- - latitude: Note latitude
-- - longitude: Note longitude
-- - opened_at: Date and time when note was opened
-- - closed_at: Date and time when note was closed
-- - days_to_resolution: Days from open to close
-- - opened_by_username: Username who opened the note
-- - opening_comment: Initial comment (cleaned, max 2000 chars)
-- - total_comments: Total number of comments on the note
-- - was_reopened: Whether note was reopened before final close (0/1)
-- - closed_by_username: Username who closed the note
-- - closing_comment: Comment when note was closed (cleaned, max 2000 chars)
--
-- Usage:
--   This SQL is used by bin/dwh/exportAndPushCSVToGitHub.sh
--   The script replaces :country_id and :max_notes_per_country with actual
--   values before execution
--   :country_id - Country ID to export
--   :max_notes_per_country - Maximum number of notes to export
--                            (default: 400000)
--                            This limits export to most recent notes to keep
--                            files under 100MB

-- Helper function to clean comment text for CSV export
-- - Replaces multiple newlines/tabs with single space
-- - Converts double quotes to single quotes
-- - Truncates to max length (2000 chars)
-- - Removes leading/trailing whitespace
