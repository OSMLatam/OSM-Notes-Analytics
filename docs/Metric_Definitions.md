## Metric Calculation Details

### How Metrics Are Calculated

**Source Data**: All metrics are calculated from `dwh.facts` table aggregated by:
- **User Datamart**: Grouped by `action_dimension_id_user`
- **Country Datamart**: Grouped by `dimension_id_country`

**Calculation Process**:
1. Read facts from `dwh.facts`
2. Filter by user/country
3. Aggregate by time period (whole, year, month, day)
4. Calculate derived metrics (averages, percentages, distributions)
5. Store in datamart table

**Update Frequency**:
- **Incremental**: Only modified entities updated
- **Full**: All entities recalculated (rare, for schema changes)

---

## Metric Interpretation Guide

### Understanding Metric Values

**Count Metrics** (integers):
- **High**: Above average for user/country type
- **Medium**: Average for user/country type
- **Low**: Below average

**Rate Metrics** (percentages):
- **Excellent**: Top 25% of values
- **Good**: 25-75th percentile
- **Needs Improvement**: Bottom 25%

**Time Metrics** (days):
- **Fast**: Below median
- **Average**: Around median
- **Slow**: Above median

### Comparing Metrics

**User vs Country**:
- User metrics show individual contribution
- Country metrics show community performance

**Time Periods**:
- Compare whole history vs current year to see trends
- Compare year vs month to see recent activity

**Ratios**:
- Resolution rate = closed / opened
- Comment rate = commented / opened
- Reopen rate = reopened / opened
