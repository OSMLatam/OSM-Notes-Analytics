# Business Glossary

This document provides business definitions for terms, concepts, and metrics used in the OSM-Notes-Analytics system. These definitions are written from a business perspective to help stakeholders understand what the data means and how to interpret it.

## Overview

This glossary serves multiple purposes:
- **Communication**: Common language between technical and business teams
- **Documentation**: Clear definitions for metrics and terms
- **Onboarding**: Help new team members understand the domain
- **Compliance**: Documented business rules and definitions

## Core Business Terms

### Note

**Definition**: A user-reported issue or feedback about the OpenStreetMap data. Notes represent discrepancies between reality and what's mapped, requests for mapping, or questions about map features.

**Business Context**: Notes are the primary mechanism for users to provide feedback to the OSM community. They can be opened, commented on, closed (resolved), or reopened if the issue persists.

**Types of Note Actions**:
- **Opened**: A new note is created
- **Commented**: Someone adds a comment to an existing note
- **Closed**: The note is marked as resolved
- **Reopened**: A closed note is reopened because the issue wasn't fully resolved
- **Hidden**: The note is hidden (rare, usually for spam)

**Related Terms**: Note ID, Note Comment, Note Resolution

---

### Resolution

**Definition**: The process of addressing and closing a note, indicating that the reported issue has been fixed or addressed.

**Business Context**: Resolution demonstrates that the OSM community is responsive to user feedback. High resolution rates indicate a healthy, active mapping community.

**Resolution Metrics**:
- **Resolution Rate**: Percentage of opened notes that have been closed
- **Days to Resolution**: Time from note opening to closure
- **Resolution Quality**: Whether notes are closed with explanatory comments

**Related Terms**: Days to Resolution, Resolution Rate, Closed Note

---

### Active User

**Definition**: A user who has created or resolved at least one note within a specified time period.

**Business Context**: Active users are the core contributors to the OSM notes ecosystem. Tracking active users helps measure community engagement and growth.

**Time Periods**:
- **Currently Active**: Action in the last 30 days
- **Yearly Active**: Action in the current year
- **Historically Active**: Has ever created or resolved a note

**Related Terms**: User Activity, Contributor, Mapper

---

### Community Health

**Definition**: Overall indicators of how well a geographic community (country, region) is managing and resolving notes.

**Business Context**: Community health metrics help identify:
- Which communities need support
- Which communities are thriving
- Trends in note management effectiveness

**Indicators**:
- Resolution rate
- Average resolution time
- Backlog size (unresolved notes)
- Active user count
- Notes per active user ratio

**Related Terms**: Backlog, Resolution Rate, Active Notes

---

### Backlog

**Definition**: The number of notes that are currently open (not yet resolved).

**Business Context**: A large backlog may indicate:
- High volume of new issues
- Low resolution activity
- Complex issues requiring more time
- Need for community support

**Measurement**: Count of notes where `action_comment = 'opened'` and no subsequent `action_comment = 'closed'` exists.

**Related Terms**: Open Notes, Unresolved Notes, Active Notes

---

### Contributor Type

**Definition**: Classification of users based on their contribution patterns and activity levels.

**Business Context**: Understanding contributor types helps:
- Identify power users who can mentor others
- Recognize bot/automated contributions
- Measure community diversity

**Types** (from `dwh.contributor_types`):
- **Normal**: Regular contributor
- **Power**: High-activity contributor
- **Epic**: Very high-activity contributor
- **Bot**: Automated contributions
- **Legendary**: Exceptional long-term contributor

**Related Terms**: User Classification, Experience Level, Automation Level

---

### Hashtag Campaign

**Definition**: Use of hashtags in notes to organize, track, or promote specific mapping initiatives or themes.

**Business Context**: Hashtags enable:
- Campaign tracking (e.g., #MissingMaps, #Mapathon2024)
- Thematic organization
- Community coordination
- Performance measurement of initiatives

**Metrics**:
- Hashtag usage frequency
- Resolution rates for hashtagged notes

**Interpretation**: Higher values may indicate:
- Issues weren't fully resolved
- Complex problems requiring multiple attempts
- Quality control (reopening incorrectly closed notes)

**Business Use Cases**:
- Problem identification: "This note was reopened 3 times (complex issue)"
- Quality measurement: "Low reopen rate indicates good resolution quality"
- User behavior: "This user reopens notes that weren't properly fixed"

---

### Resolution Metrics

#### Average Days to Resolution (`resolution_avg_days`)

**Unit**: Percentage (0-100)  
**Interpretation**: Higher values indicate better community responsiveness:
- **Excellent**: > 80%
- **Good**: 60-80%
- **Acceptable**: 40-60%
- **Needs Improvement**: < 40%

**Business Use Cases**:
- Community health: "Colombia has an 85% resolution rate"
- Trend analysis: "Resolution rate improved from 60% to 75% this year"
- Comparison: "Country A resolves 90% of notes, Country B resolves 50%"

**Note**: This is a ratio, not a count. A rate of 75% means 3 out of 4 notes are resolved.

---

#### Days to Resolution Active (`days_to_resolution_active`)

**Business Name**: Total Days Note Was Open  
**Definition**: Sum of all days a note was in open status, accounting for reopens.  
**Formula**: Sum of all open periods (from open/reopen to close/reopen)  
**Unit**: Days (integer)  
**Interpretation**: Accounts for notes that were reopened. If a note was open for 10 days, closed, then reopened for 5 more days, this metric = 15 days.

**Business Use Cases**:
- Accurate time tracking: "This note was open for 45 total days (including reopens)"
- Complex issue measurement: "Notes with reopens take longer to fully resolve"
- Quality analysis: "High active days may indicate persistent problems"

**Difference from `days_to_resolution`**: This metric handles reopens correctly, while `days_to_resolution` only measures first open to final close.

## Business Rules

### Rule 1: One Fact Per Action
- **Business Rule**: Each note action (open, comment, close, reopen) creates exactly one fact row
- **Rationale**: Ensures accurate counting and prevents double-counting
- **Exception**: None

### Rule 2: Resolution Metrics Only for Closed Notes
- **Business Rule**: Resolution time metrics are only calculated for notes that have been closed
- **Rationale**: Open notes don't have a resolution time yet
- **Impact**: Resolution averages exclude currently open notes

### Rule 3: Recent Open Date Always Set
- **Business Rule**: `recent_opened_dimension_id_date` must always have a value (NOT NULL)
- **Rationale**: Needed for accurate resolution calculations, especially for reopened notes
- **Enforcement**: Set during unify step after all facts are loaded

### Rule 4: Datamart Incremental Updates
- **Business Rule**: Only update datamarts for entities that have changed (`modified = TRUE`)
- **Rationale**: Improves performance by avoiding unnecessary recalculations
- **Impact**: Datamarts may be slightly stale for unchanged entities

### Rule 5: JSON Schema Validation
- **Business Rule**: All exported JSON must validate against schema before being written
- **Rationale**: Ensures data quality and prevents invalid exports
- **Action on Failure**: Keep existing files, log error, exit with error code

---

## Metric Calculation Examples

### Example 1: User Resolution Rate

**Scenario**: User "AngocA" has opened 100 notes and closed 75 notes.

**Calculation**:
```
resolution_rate = (75 / 100) * 100 = 75%
```

**Business Interpretation**: "AngocA has resolved 75% of the notes they created, which is above the community average of 65%. This indicates strong follow-through on reported issues."

---

### Example 2: Country Average Resolution Time

**Scenario**: Colombia has 1,000 closed notes with resolution times: 500 notes at 5 days, 300 at 10 days, 200 at 30 days.

**Calculation**:
```
Average = (500*5 + 300*10 + 200*30) / 1000
        = (2500 + 3000 + 6000) / 1000
        = 11.5 days
```

**Business Interpretation**: "Colombia's average resolution time is 11.5 days, which is excellent (below 30 days). Most notes resolve quickly, with some complex issues taking longer."

---

### Example 3: Working Hours Pattern

**Scenario**: User's `working_hours_of_week_opening` shows peak at hour 80 (Thursday 8:00 AM).

**Calculation**:
```
Hour 80 = (Thursday = day 4) * 24 + 8 = 80 + 8 = 88
Wait, let's recalculate:
Sunday = 0-23 (hours 0-23)
Monday = 24-47 (hours 24-47)
Tuesday = 48-71 (hours 48-71)
Wednesday = 72-95 (hours 72-95)
Thursday = 96-119 (hours 96-119)

Hour 80 = Wednesday 8:00 AM
```

**Business Interpretation**: "This user is most active on Wednesday mornings, suggesting they map during work hours or have a regular mapping schedule."
