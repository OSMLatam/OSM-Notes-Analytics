## Documentation Standards

### Markdown Style

All documentation follows these standards:

- **Headers:** Use ATX-style headers (`#`, `##`, `###`)
- **Code blocks:** Use fenced code blocks with language specification
- **Links:** Use reference-style links for readability
- **Lists:** Use `-` for unordered lists, numbers for ordered lists
- **Emphasis:** Use `**bold**` for important terms, `*italic*` for emphasis
- **Tables:** Use GitHub-flavored markdown tables
- **Diagrams:** Use Mermaid for diagrams when possible

### Content Structure

Standard document structure:

1. **Title and Overview**
2. **Table of Contents** (for long documents)
3. **Main Content** (organized by topic)
4. **Examples** (practical demonstrations)
5. **Troubleshooting** (common issues)
6. **References** (related documents)

### Code Examples

All code examples should:

- Be tested and verified
- Include comments explaining key points
- Show realistic use cases
- Follow project coding standards

### Diagrams

- Use Mermaid for architecture and flow diagrams
- Use ASCII art for simple diagrams
- Use external tools only when necessary
- Include diagram source in comments
