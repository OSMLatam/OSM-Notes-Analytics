# Partitioning Strategy - dwh.facts

**Version**: 2025-10-21  
**Author**: Andres Gomez (AngocA)

## üìä Overview

The `dwh.facts` table is partitioned by year using the `action_at` column as the partitioning key. This dramatically improves the performance of queries that filter by date.

---

## üèóÔ∏è Partition Structure

```
dwh.facts (main table - PARTITIONED)
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ facts_2013 (2013-01-01 to 2013-12-31)
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ facts_2014 (2014-01-01 to 2014-12-31)
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ facts_2015 (2015-01-01 to 2015-12-31)
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ ...
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ facts_2024 (2024-01-01 to 2024-12-31)
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ facts_2025 (2025-01-01 to 2025-12-31)
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ facts_2026 (2026-01-01 to 2026-12-31) [created automatically]
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ facts_default (any future date beyond)
```

### Characteristics:

- **Partitioning type**: RANGE by `action_at`
- **Granularity**: Annual (one partition per year)
- **Range**: 2013 to current year + 1
- **DEFAULT partition**: Captures any future date not covered

---

## üöÄ Automatic Creation

Partitions are created automatically during the ETL process:

### First Execution (ETL --create)

```bash
./bin/dwh/ETL.sh --create
```

The ETL executes these steps:
1. `ETL_22_createDWHTables.sql` - Creates main partitioned table
2. `ETL_22a_createFactPartitions.sql` - Creates partitions from 2013 to current_year + 1
3. Loads data directly into partitions

### Incremental Executions

```bash
./bin/dwh/ETL.sh --incremental
```

- Existing partitions are reused
- New data is inserted into the corresponding partition based on `action_at`
- PostgreSQL automatically routes each row to its partition

---

## ‚ûï Adding New Partitions

### üéâ **NO MANUAL ACTION REQUIRED!**

The ETL **automatically verifies and creates** necessary partitions on each execution:

```bash
# Simply run the ETL (--create or --incremental)
./bin/dwh/ETL.sh --incremental

# The ETL automatically:
# ‚úÖ Verifies if partition for current year exists
# ‚úÖ Creates partition for current year if it doesn't exist
# ‚úÖ Creates partition for next year (buffer)
# ‚úÖ Creates partition for year + 2 (extra buffer)
# ‚úÖ Never fails due to missing partitions
```

### Year Transition Scenario

**January 1st, 2026 - First execution of the year:**

```bash
./bin/dwh/ETL.sh --incremental

# ETL Output:
# "Verifying and creating partitions for dwh.facts"
# "Current year: 2026, ensuring partitions exist up to 2028"
# "‚úì Created partition for CURRENT YEAR: facts_2026 [2026-01-01 to 2027-01-01)"
# "‚úì Created partition for NEXT YEAR: facts_2027 [2027-01-01 to 2028-01-01)"
# "  Created partition: facts_2028 [2028-01-01 to 2029-01-01)"
# "==> Created 3 new partition(s)"
# "==> Partition verification completed successfully"
```

**Subsequent executions in 2026:**

```bash
./bin/dwh/ETL.sh --incremental

# ETL Output:
# "‚úì Partition facts_2026 already exists"
# "‚úì Partition facts_2027 already exists"
# "‚úì Partition facts_2028 already exists"
# "==> All required partitions already exist"
```

### Manual Methods (Rarely Needed)

If for some reason you need to create partitions manually:

#### Method 1: Re-run partition script (Recommended)

```bash
psql -d notes -f sql/dwh/ETL_22a_createFactPartitions.sql
```

This script is idempotent and only creates missing partitions.

#### Method 2: Direct SQL

```sql
-- Example: Create partition for 2027
CREATE TABLE dwh.facts_2027 PARTITION OF dwh.facts
  FOR VALUES FROM ('2027-01-01') TO ('2028-01-01');

-- Verify creation
SELECT tablename FROM pg_tables 
WHERE schemaname = 'dwh' AND tablename = 'facts_2027';
```

---

## üîç Verifying Partitions

### List all partitions

```sql
SELECT 
  schemaname,
  tablename,
  pg_size_pretty(pg_total_relation_size(schemaname||'.'||tablename)) as size
FROM pg_tables
WHERE schemaname = 'dwh' 
  AND tablename LIKE 'facts_%'
ORDER BY tablename;
```

### View partition definitions

```sql
SELECT 
  parent.relname AS parent_table,
  child.relname AS partition_name,
  pg_get_expr(child.relpartbound, child.oid, true) AS partition_expression
FROM pg_inherits
JOIN pg_class parent ON pg_inherits.inhparent = parent.oid
JOIN pg_class child ON pg_inherits.inhrelid = child.oid
WHERE parent.relname = 'facts'
ORDER BY partition_name;
```

### View partition statistics

```sql
SELECT 
  schemaname,
  tablename,
  n_tup_ins as inserts,
  n_tup_upd as updates,
  n_tup_del as deletes,
  n_live_tup as live_rows,
  n_dead_tup as dead_rows,
  last_vacuum,
  last_autovacuum,
  last_analyze,
  last_autoanalyze
FROM pg_stat_user_tables
WHERE schemaname = 'dwh' 
  AND tablename LIKE 'facts_%'
ORDER BY tablename;
```

## üéØ Performance: Partition Pruning

PostgreSQL automatically uses **partition pruning** to avoid scanning unnecessary partitions:

### Example: Query with date range

```sql
-- Only scans facts_2024
SELECT COUNT(*) 
FROM dwh.facts 
WHERE action_at BETWEEN '2024-01-01' AND '2024-12-31';

-- Verify partition pruning with EXPLAIN
EXPLAIN (ANALYZE, BUFFERS)
SELECT COUNT(*) 
FROM dwh.facts 
WHERE action_at >= '2024-01-01' 
  AND action_at < '2025-01-01';
```

**Expected output:**
```
Aggregate  (actual time=123.456..123.457 rows=1 loops=1)
  ->  Seq Scan on facts_2024 facts  (actual time=0.015..98.765 rows=4000000 loops=1)
        Filter: ((action_at >= '2024-01-01'::date) AND (action_at < '2025-01-01'::date))
Planning Time: 0.123 ms
Execution Time: 123.678 ms
```

Note: **Only scans facts_2024**, not all partitions.

### Queries that DON'T use partition pruning

```sql
-- ‚ùå BAD: No filter on action_at
SELECT * FROM dwh.facts WHERE id_note = 12345;
-- Scans ALL partitions

-- ‚úÖ GOOD: With filter on action_at
SELECT * FROM dwh.facts 
WHERE id_note = 12345 
  AND action_at >= '2024-01-01';
-- Only scans facts_2024
```

**Golden rule**: Always include filter on `action_at` for maximum performance.

## üßπ Maintenance

### VACUUM by partition (Recommended)

```sql
-- VACUUM a specific partition (faster)
VACUUM ANALYZE dwh.facts_2024;

-- VACUUM all partitions (slower)
VACUUM ANALYZE dwh.facts;
```

### REINDEX by partition

```sql
-- Reindex a specific partition
REINDEX TABLE dwh.facts_2024;

-- Reindex all partitions
REINDEX TABLE dwh.facts;
```

### Autovacuum configuration by partition

```sql
-- Configure more aggressive autovacuum on recent partitions
ALTER TABLE dwh.facts_2024 SET (
  autovacuum_vacuum_scale_factor = 0.05,
  autovacuum_analyze_scale_factor = 0.02
);

-- Configure less frequent autovacuum on old partitions
ALTER TABLE dwh.facts_2013 SET (
  autovacuum_vacuum_scale_factor = 0.2,
  autovacuum_analyze_scale_factor = 0.1
);
```

---

## üì¶ Archiving Historical Data

If you need to archive or remove old data:

### Option 1: DETACH partition (recommended)

```sql
-- Detach 2013 partition (not deleted)
ALTER TABLE dwh.facts DETACH PARTITION dwh.facts_2013;

-- Now facts_2013 is an independent table
-- You can export it, move it to another tablespace, or delete it

-- Export to file
COPY dwh.facts_2013 TO '/backups/facts_2013.csv' CSV HEADER;

-- Delete if necessary
DROP TABLE dwh.facts_2013;
```

### Option 2: DROP partition (faster)

```sql
-- Delete partition and its data directly
ALTER TABLE dwh.facts DROP PARTITION dwh.facts_2013;
-- ‚ö†Ô∏è WARNING: This deletes ALL 2013 data
```

---

## üîß Troubleshooting

### Problem: "no partition of relation for tuple"

**Error:**
```
ERROR: no partition of relation "facts" found for row
DETAIL: Partition key of the failing row contains (action_at) = (2030-05-15).
```

**Solution:**
```bash
# Create partition for 2030
./bin/dwh/addNewYearPartition.sh 2030
```

### Problem: Query still slow even with partitioning

**Check:**

1. Are you filtering by `action_at`?
   ```sql
   -- Check if it uses partition pruning
   EXPLAIN SELECT * FROM dwh.facts WHERE id_note = 123;
   ```

2. Do indexes exist on partitions?
   ```sql
   -- Verify indexes
   SELECT tablename, indexname 
   FROM pg_indexes 
   WHERE schemaname = 'dwh' AND tablename LIKE 'facts_%'
   ORDER BY tablename, indexname;
   ```

3. Are statistics up to date?
   ```sql
   ANALYZE dwh.facts;
   ```
