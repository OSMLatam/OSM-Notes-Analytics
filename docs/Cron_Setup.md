## Overview

Cron automation allows the ETL process to run automatically at regular intervals without manual
intervention. This is essential for keeping the data warehouse up-to-date with new OSM notes.

### Why Use Cron?

- **Automated Updates**: Process new notes every 15 minutes
- **Consistent Data**: Always have fresh data available
- **Minimal Overhead**: Only processes new/changed data
- **Production Ready**: Suitable for production environments

---

## Prerequisites

### Required Components

1. **ETL Script**: `bin/dwh/ETL.sh` (already exists)
2. **Cron Configuration**: `etc/cron.example` (template provided)
3. **Monitoring**: Handled by the Monitoring project (sister project)

### System Requirements

- Linux/Unix system with cron installed
- Sufficient disk space for logs (/tmp)
- Database connectivity configured
- Write permissions to log directories

---

## Installation

### Step 1: Create Cron Configuration

Copy the example configuration:

```bash
cp etc/cron.example /tmp/osm-notes-cron
```

### Step 2: Edit Configuration

Edit `/tmp/osm-notes-cron` and update the paths:

```bash
# Example configuration (production path):
*/15 * * * * export CLEAN=false ; export LOG_LEVEL=INFO ; export DBNAME=notes ; export DB_USER=notes ; /home/notes/OSM-Notes-Analytics/bin/dwh/ETL.sh
```

**Production Configuration**:

- `CLEAN=false`: Keeps temporary files for debugging (use `CLEAN=true` to save disk space)
- `LOG_LEVEL=INFO`: Balanced logging (use `ERROR` for less verbose, `DEBUG` for debugging)
- `DBNAME=notes`: Your database name
- `DB_USER=notes`: Your database user

Also update:

- `SHELL=/bin/bash` (if using different shell)
- `HOME=/home/your-username` (your actual home directory)
- Any other paths as needed

### Step 3: Install Cron Job

Install the cron configuration:

```bash
crontab /tmp/osm-notes-cron
```

### Step 4: Verify Installation

Check that cron is installed correctly:

```bash
crontab -l
```

You should see output like:

```
*/15 * * * * export CLEAN=false ; export LOG_LEVEL=INFO ; export DBNAME=notes ; export DB_USER=notes ; /home/notes/OSM-Notes-Analytics/bin/dwh/ETL.sh
0 2 15 * * /home/notes/OSM-Notes-Analytics/bin/dwh/exportAndPushCSVToGitHub.sh
0 4 1 * * /home/notes/OSM-Notes-Analytics/bin/dwh/ml_retrain.sh >> /tmp/ml-retrain.log 2>&1
```

## Configuration

### ETL Execution Frequency

Choose the appropriate frequency based on your needs:

| Frequency            | Schedule       | Use Case                     |
| -------------------- | -------------- | ---------------------------- |
| **Every 15 minutes** | `*/15 * * * *` | Production, frequent updates |
| **Every hour**       | `0 * * * *`    | Standard updates             |
| **Every 3 hours**    | `0 */3 * * *`  | Moderate updates             |
| **Daily**            | `0 2 * * *`    | Low-frequency updates        |

### Lock File Behavior

The ETL automatically creates lock files to prevent concurrent execution:

- **Lock exists**: New job skips execution
- **Lock older than 4 hours**: Considered stale, job proceeds
- **Lock created**: Current execution timestamp

This ensures that:

- If ETL takes >15 minutes, next job waits
- No duplicate executions
- System remains stable

### Log Management

ETL logs are stored in `/tmp/ETL_XXXXXX/` directories.

**Automatic cleanup** is configured in cron:

```cron
30 3 * * 0 find /tmp/ETL_* -type d -mtime +7 -exec rm -rf {} \; 2>/dev/null || true
```

This removes logs older than 7 days every Sunday at 3:30 AM.

---

## Monitoring

Monitoring is handled by the **Monitoring project** (sister project located at the same filesystem
level as this project). Configure monitoring tasks in that project instead.

The Monitoring project provides:

- Process status monitoring (running/not running)
- Last execution log tracking
- Database connection status checks
- Data warehouse statistics
- Disk space usage monitoring
- Email alerts for failures

---

## Troubleshooting

### Issue: Cron Job Not Running

**Check cron service**:

```bash
# Check if cron is running
systemctl status cron

# Start cron if needed
sudo systemctl start cron
```

**Check cron logs**:

```bash
# View cron execution logs
sudo tail -f /var/log/syslog | grep CRON

# On some systems:
sudo tail -f /var/log/cron
```

### Issue: "Permission Denied"

**Check permissions**:

```bash
# Script must be executable
chmod +x bin/dwh/ETL.sh

# All scripts should be readable
ls -la bin/dwh/*.sh
```

### Issue: "Command Not Found"

**Check PATH**: Cron jobs have limited PATH. Use full paths:

```bash
# Good
/home/notes/OSM-Notes-Analytics/bin/dwh/ETL.sh

# Bad
bin/dwh/ETL.sh
```

### Issue: Database Connection Failed

**Check environment**: Cron doesn't inherit your shell environment. Add to cron:

```cron
# Load environment
. /home/your-username/.bashrc
```

Or explicitly set variables in cron:

```cron
DBHOST=localhost
DBPORT=5432
DBUSER=postgres
# Database configuration (recommended: use DBNAME_INGESTION and DBNAME_DWH)
DBNAME_INGESTION=notes_dwh
DBNAME_DWH=notes_dwh
# Legacy/compatibility (use when both databases are the same):
# DBNAME=notes_dwh
```

### Issue: Lock File Never Released

**Stale lock file**: If ETL crashes, lock file may remain:

```bash
# Find lock files
find /tmp/ETL_* -name "ETL.lock"

# Check age
ls -lh /tmp/ETL_*/ETL.lock

# Remove if stale (>4 hours old)
find /tmp/ETL_* -name "ETL.lock" -mmin +240 -delete
```

---

## Best Practices

### 1. Test Before Production

Test cron jobs manually first:

```bash
# Run ETL manually
/home/notes/OSM-Notes-Analytics/bin/dwh/ETL.sh

# Check output
tail -f /tmp/ETL_*/ETL.log
```

### 2. Start with Conservative Schedule

Begin with less frequent execution:

```cron
# Start with hourly updates
0 * * * * export CLEAN=false ; export LOG_LEVEL=INFO ; export DBNAME_INGESTION=notes ; export DBNAME_DWH=notes_dwh ; export DB_USER=notes ; /home/notes/OSM-Notes-Analytics/bin/dwh/ETL.sh
```

Then increase frequency based on performance.

### 3. Monitor Disk Space

Watch log directory size:

```bash
# Check disk usage
du -sh /tmp/ETL_*

# Set up alert in cron
0 4 * * * du -sh /tmp/ETL_* | mail -s "ETL Log Size" notes@osm.lat
```

### 4. Regular Maintenance

Add these tasks to cron:

```cron
# Weekly VACUUM ANALYZE
0 3 * * 0 psql -U notes -d notes_dwh -c "VACUUM ANALYZE dwh.facts"

# Weekly log cleanup
30 3 * * 0 find /tmp/ETL_* -type d -mtime +7 -exec rm -rf {} \;
```

### 5. Backup Strategy

Implement backups:

```cron
# Daily DWH backup
0 1 * * * pg_dump -U notes -d notes_dwh -n dwh > /backups/dwh_$(date +\%Y\%m\%d).sql

# Keep last 30 days
0 2 * * * find /backups/dwh_*.sql -mtime +30 -delete
```

### 6. Error Handling

Monitor for failures:

```bash
# Check for errors in logs
find /tmp/ETL_* -name "ETL.log" -exec grep -i error {} \; | tail -20

# Set up daily error report (or configure in Monitoring project)
0 7 * * * find /tmp/ETL_* -name "ETL.log" -exec grep -i error {} \; | tail -50 | mail -s "ETL Errors" notes@osm.lat
```

---

## Advanced Configuration

### Running Multiple ETL Jobs

You can run different ETL operations at different times:

```cron
# Incremental updates every 15 minutes (production)
*/15 * * * * export CLEAN=false ; export LOG_LEVEL=INFO ; export DBNAME=notes ; export DB_USER=notes ; /home/notes/OSM-Notes-Analytics/bin/dwh/ETL.sh

# Export CSV monthly (15th day at 2 AM)
0 2 15 * * /home/notes/OSM-Notes-Analytics/bin/dwh/exportAndPushCSVToGitHub.sh

# ML training/retraining monthly (1st day at 4 AM)
0 4 1 * * /home/notes/OSM-Notes-Analytics/bin/dwh/ml_retrain.sh >> /tmp/ml-retrain.log 2>&1

# Full reload every Sunday at 2 AM (if needed)
0 2 * * 0 /home/notes/OSM-Notes-Analytics/bin/dwh/ETL.sh
```

### Custom Log Rotation

ETL logs are stored in `/tmp/ETL_XXXXXX/` directories. Automatic cleanup is configured in cron (see
`etc/cron.example`).

### Conditional Execution

Run ETL only during business hours:

```cron
# Only run 8 AM - 8 PM
*/15 8-20 * * * export CLEAN=false ; export LOG_LEVEL=INFO ; export DBNAME_INGESTION=notes ; export DBNAME_DWH=notes_dwh ; export DB_USER=notes ; /home/notes/OSM-Notes-Analytics/bin/dwh/ETL.sh
```
