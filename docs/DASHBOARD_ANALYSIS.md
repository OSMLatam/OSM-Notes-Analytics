## üìä Executive Summary

This document analyzes the data available in the OSM Notes Analytics data warehouse (star schema) versus what's exposed through the datamarts. It identifies gaps, recommendations for dashboard implementation, and documents the enhancements implemented in October 2025.

### Recent Enhancements (October 2025)
The datamarts were enhanced with 21 new metrics across 4 categories:
- **Resolution Metrics**: Average/median days to resolution, resolution rates
- **Application Statistics**: Usage patterns, mobile vs desktop apps
- **Content Quality Metrics**: Comment analysis, URLs, mentions
- **Community Health Metrics**: Active notes, backlog, age distribution, recent activity

## üìã Recommendations for Dashboard Implementation

### Phase 1: Use Existing Datamart Data (Quick Wins)

#### Dashboards Ready NOW

1. **Country Activity Dashboard**
   - ‚úÖ Use `datamartCountries` table
   - Historical counts (whole/year/month/day)
   - Activity heatmaps
   - Contributor rankings
   - Peak activity dates

2. **User Profile Dashboard**
   - ‚úÖ Use `datamartUsers` table
   - Historical activity
   - Geographic distribution
   - Working hours patterns
   - Badges and contributor type

3. **Global Overview Dashboard**
   - ‚úÖ Aggregate from both datamarts
   - Total notes globally
   - Active countries/users
   - Activity trends over time

### Phase 2: Query Star Schema for Enhanced Metrics

#### Dashboards Requiring Star Schema Queries

1. **Resolution Time Dashboard** (Query `dwh.facts`)
   - Average resolution time by country
   - Median resolution time
   - Resolution time trends
   - Notes with longest resolution time
   - Top problem notes (multiple reopens)

2. **Application Usage Dashboard** (Query `dwh.facts`)
   - Application breakdown by country
   - Usage trends over time
   - Version adoption
   - Mobile vs desktop

3. **Content Quality Dashboard** (Query `dwh.facts`)
   - Average comment length
   - URL usage rate
   - Mention rate
   - Engagement metrics

### Phase 3: Add Missing Metrics to Datamarts

#### Recommended Enhancements

1. **Resolution Time Metrics** (Add to datamarts)
   ```sql
   -- Average resolution time
   avg_days_to_resolution DECIMAL,
   median_days_to_resolution DECIMAL,
   notes_resolved_count INTEGER,
   notes_still_open_count INTEGER,
   resolution_rate DECIMAL -- (resolved/total opened)
   ```

2. **Application Statistics** (Add to datamarts)
   ```sql
   applications_used JSON, -- {app_id: count}
   applications_used_recent JSON,
   most_used_application VARCHAR,
   mobile_apps_count INTEGER,
   desktop_apps_count INTEGER
   ```

3. **Content Quality Metrics** (Add to datamarts)
   ```sql
   avg_comment_length DECIMAL,
   comments_with_url_pct DECIMAL,
   comments_with_mention_pct DECIMAL,
   avg_comments_per_note DECIMAL
   ```

4. **Community Health Metrics** (Add to datamarts)
   ```sql
   active_notes_count INTEGER,
   resolved_notes_count INTEGER,
   notes_backlog_size INTEGER,
   resolution_rate DECIMAL,
   notes_age_distribution JSON -- {age_range: count}
   ```

## üîß Implementation Recommendations

### 1. **Query Performance**
   - ‚úÖ Datamarts are already optimized for common queries
   - ‚ö†Ô∏è Complex star schema queries may be slow (consider materialized views)
   - üí° Consider adding indexes on frequently queried fields

### 2. **Data Freshness**
   - ‚úÖ Datamarts update incrementally (only modified countries/users)
   - ‚úÖ Activity tiles update daily
   - ‚ö†Ô∏è Real-time dashboards will require direct queries to `dwh.facts`

### 3. **JSON Export**
   - ‚úÖ `exportDatamartsToJSON.sh` already exports datamart data
   - ‚ö†Ô∏è Consider expanding JSON schema to include new metrics
   - üí° Add API endpoints for real-time queries

### 4. **Dashboard Architecture**

**Recommended Structure:**
```
Level 1: Global Overview (datamartCountries aggregated)
  - Total notes globally
  - Active countries/users
  - Trends over time
  
Level 2: Country Drill-Down (datamartCountries)
  - Country-specific metrics
  - Historical trends
  - Contributors
  
Level 3: User Profiles (datamartUsers)
  - User-specific metrics
  - Geographic distribution
  - Badges
  
Level 4: Deep Analytics (dwh.facts queries)
  - Resolution time analysis
  - Application usage
  - Content quality
  - Problem notes
```

## ‚úÖ Completeness Checklist

### Current State: ~60% Complete for Dashboard

- ‚úÖ Temporal analysis: **COMPLETE**
- ‚úÖ Geographic analysis: **COMPLETE** (countries only)
- ‚úÖ User engagement: **COMPLETE**
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Resolution metrics: **PARTIAL** (data available, not aggregated)
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Application stats: **MISSING from datamarts**
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Content quality: **MISSING from datamarts**
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Productivity metrics: **MISSING from datamarts**
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Community health: **MISSING from datamarts**

### Path to 100% Complete

**Priority 1 (Quick Wins):**
1. Add resolution time aggregates to datamarts
2. Add notes backlog tracking
3. Add resolution rate calculations

**Priority 2 (High Value):**
4. Add application statistics to datamarts
5. Add content quality metrics to datamarts
6. Add user behavior patterns to datamarts

**Priority 3 (Enhancement):**
7. Add continent/region aggregates
8. Add local time pattern analysis
9. Add seasonal patterns analysis
10. Add hashtag deep dive analysis

## üéØ Conclusion

The OSM Notes Analytics data warehouse has **excellent coverage** for temporal and geographic analysis. The datamarts provide **ready-to-use data** for country and user dashboards. However, to create a **comprehensive dashboard**, additional metrics should be added to the datamarts or queried directly from the star schema.

**Recommended Next Steps:**
1. Start with existing datamart data for quick wins
2. Query star schema for resolution time and application metrics
3. Gradually enhance datamarts with missing metrics
4. Consider materialized views for complex queries
5. Expand JSON export schema for new metrics
