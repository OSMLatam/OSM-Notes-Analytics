## Integration with Development

### Git Workflow

When working on tasks from ActionPlan:

```bash

git checkout -b fix/test-failures-datamarts

# Make changes
# ...

# Commit with reference
git commit -m "Fix: datamart calculation tests

Resolves ActionPlan Test #1
Fixes failing tests in resolution metrics
Updates test expectations to match actual data

Related files:
- tests/unit/bash/datamart_resolution_metrics.test.bats"

# Update ActionPlan.md
# Mark [‚úÖ] Test #1
# Update ProgressTracker.md
```

### GitHub Issues (Optional)

For major tasks, create GitHub issues:

```markdown
Title: Add resolution time aggregates to datamarts

**Reference**: ActionPlan.md - Metrics #1  
**Priority**: üü° High

**Description**:
Missing resolution time analytics in datamarts.

**Impact**: Critical for problem notes analysis

**Files**:

## Tips

1. **Be realistic**: Don't mark items as done unless fully complete
2. **Document blockers**: If stuck, note why in ProgressTracker
3. **Update regularly**: Keep both files in sync
4. **Use references**: Link commits, PRs, and issues
5. **Celebrate wins**: Log completed items in ProgressTracker
6. **Adjust priorities**: Move urgent items up as needed
7. **Break down large tasks**: Split into smaller, actionable items
