## How to Use This Document

- [ ] Not started
- [üîÑ] In progress
- [‚úÖ] Completed
- [‚ùå] Cancelled/Not needed

**Priority Levels:**
- üî¥ **CRITICAL**: Issues affecting data quality or system functionality
- üü° **HIGH**: Important improvements for accuracy and performance
- üü† **MEDIUM**: Enhancements and optimizations
- üü¢ **LOW**: Nice-to-have features and polish

---

## üî¥ CRITICAL PRIORITY

### Test Failures and Data Quality

- [‚úÖ] **Test #1**: Fix failing unit tests in datamarts - COMPLETED
  - **Issue**: Tests were failing when DBNAME not configured instead of skipping gracefully
  - **Files**: `tests/unit/bash/datamartUsers_resolution_metrics.test.bats`, `datamart_application_statistics.test.bats`, `datamart_content_quality.test.bats`, `datamart_resolution_metrics.test.bats`, `tests/properties.sh`
  - **Priority**: Must fix before merging changes
  - **Solution**: Added DBNAME check in setup() functions and modified properties.sh to not set default TEST_DBNAME
  - **Result**: All tests now properly skip with "skip No database configured" message when DBNAME is not set
  - **Status**: COMPLETED - Tests skip gracefully without attempting database operations

### Data Accuracy Issues

- [‚úÖ] **Issue #1**: Verify datamart calculations match star schema queries - COMPLETED
  - **Check**: All 21 new metrics in datamartCountries and datamartUsers
  - **Compare**: Datamart results vs direct facts table aggregations
  - **Bug Found**: Procedure uses non-existent `opened_dimension_id_country` column
  - **Fix**: Changed to use `dimension_id_country` with `action_comment = 'opened'` filter
  - **Files**: 
    - sql/dwh/datamartCountries/datamartCountries_13_createProcedure.sql (FIXED)
    - sql/dwh/improvements/verify_datamart_calculations.sql (CREATED)
    - ToDo/VERIFICATION_REPORT.md (CREATED)
  - **Priority**: Fixed critical bug that would cause incorrect application statistics
  - **Status**: COMPLETED - Bug fixed, verification script created

## üü° HIGH PRIORITY

### Missing Dashboard Metrics

Based on analysis in `docs/DASHBOARD_ANALYSIS.md`, these metrics are MISSING from datamarts:

#### Resolution Time Analytics
- [ ] **Metrics #1**: Add resolution time aggregates to datamarts
  - **Missing**:
    - Average resolution time by country
    - Median resolution time by country
    - Resolution time by year/month
    - Notes resolution rate (resolved/total opened)
    - Notes still open (tracking active issues)
  - **Impact**: ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê Critical for problem notes analysis
  - **Files**: `sql/dwh/datamartCountries/`, `sql/dwh/datamartUsers/`
  - **Priority**: Data available in facts, needs aggregation

#### Application Statistics
- [ ] **Metrics #2**: Add application breakdown to datamarts
  - **Missing**:
    - Application usage by country
    - Application trends over time
    - Version adoption rates
    - Mobile vs desktop usage
  - **Impact**: ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê High value for understanding user behavior
  - **Files**: `sql/dwh/datamartCountries/`, `sql/dwh/datamartUsers/`
  - **Priority**: Important but not blocking

#### Content Quality Metrics
- [ ] **Metrics #3**: Add content quality aggregates to datamarts
  - **Missing** (Available in facts but not aggregated):
    - Average comment length by country/user
    - Percentage of comments with URLs
    - Percentage of comments with mentions
    - Engagement rate (comments/note)
  - **Impact**: ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê Medium-high value
  - **Data**: Already calculated in `facts.comment_length`, `facts.has_url`, `facts.has_mention`
  - **Files**: `sql/dwh/datamartCountries/`, `sql/dwh/datamartUsers/`
  - **Effort**: Low (columns exist, need aggregation)

#### User Behavior Patterns
- [ ] **Metrics #4**: Add user behavior analysis to datamartUsers
  - **Missing**:
    - Notes opened but never closed by user
    - User response time (time to first comment)
    - Active vs inactive users (time since last action)
    - User collaboration patterns
  - **Impact**: ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê High value for community analysis
  - **Files**: `sql/dwh/datamartUsers/datamartUsers_13_createProcedure.sql`

#### Community Health Metrics
- [ ] **Metrics #5**: Add community health indicators
  - **Missing**:
    - Overall notes health score
    - Backlog size (unresolved notes)
    - New vs resolved notes ratio
    - Notes age distribution
  - **Impact**: ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê Critical for monitoring
  - **Files**: `sql/dwh/datamartCountries/`
  - **Priority**: High - needed for operational dashboards

## üü† MEDIUM PRIORITY

### Code Quality and Refactoring

- [ ] **REF #1**: Consolidate DWH improvements documentation
  - **Action**: Migrate completed items from `DWH_Improvements_Plan.md` to this ActionPlan
  - **Files**: `ToDo/ActionPlan.md`, `ToDo/DWH_Improvements_Plan.md`
  - **Priority**: Organize completed work for better tracking

- [ ] **REF #2**: Create comprehensive testing guide
  - **Action**: Document how to run all test suites
  - **Files**: `docs/Testing_Guide.md`

### Performance Optimizations

- [ ] **PERF #1**: Monitor and optimize datamart update times
  - **Action**: Analyze incremental update performance
