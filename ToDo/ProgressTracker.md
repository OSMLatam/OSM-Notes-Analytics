## Current Sprint Focus

**Sprint**: 1 - Test Fixes and Critical Metrics  
**Period**: Week 1  
**Status**: ðŸ”´ In Progress

### This Week's Goals
- [âœ…] Investigate test failures in datamarts (identificado: tests requieren DBNAME)
- [âœ…] Fix tests to properly skip when no DB configured
- [âœ…] Verify datamart calculations are accurate (when DB available)
- [âœ…] Test corrected calculations in development (verificado en BD)
- [ ] Add missing dashboard metrics (resolution, app stats, content quality)
- [ ] Add community health metrics

## Weekly Progress Log

### Week of 2025-01-21
- **Monday**: Created ActionPlan.md and ProgressTracker.md based on Ingestion structure
- **Monday**: Identified 4 test files with modifications pending
- **Monday**: Documented 5 missing critical metrics from dashboard analysis
- **Monday**: Investigated test failures - found that tests require DBNAME to be configured
- **Finding**: Tests should skip when no DB, but some are failing instead of skipping
- **Status**: Tests need proper skip conditions when DBNAME is not set
- **Monday**: âœ… Verified procedure fix in production DB - confirmed no references to opened_dimension_id_country
- **Monday**: âœ… Confirmed procedure now uses correct dimension_id_country with action_comment filter
- **Status**: Change validated and ready for commit

## Recently Completed

### Today (2025-01-21)
âœ… **Created Action Plan Structure** - Imported and adapted structure from OSM-Notes-Ingestion
  - Comprehensive ActionPlan.md with priorities (CRITICAL, HIGH, MEDIUM, LOW)
  - ProgressTracker.md for daily/weekly tracking  
  - README.md for workflow documentation

âœ… **Fixed Test Skipping Behavior** - Tests now properly skip when no database configured
  - Problem: Tests were attempting to run `setup_test_database` even without DBNAME
  - Solution: Added DBNAME check in setup() function of 4 test files
  - Files modified:
    - tests/unit/bash/datamart_resolution_metrics.test.bats
    - tests/unit/bash/datamart_application_statistics.test.bats
    - tests/unit/bash/datamart_content_quality.test.bats
    - tests/unit/bash/datamartUsers_resolution_metrics.test.bats
  - Modified tests/properties.sh to not set TEST_DBNAME default when unset
  - Result: All tests now properly skip with "skip No database configured" message

âœ… **Fixed Datamart Calculation Bug** - Corrected use of non-existent column `opened_dimension_id_country`
  - Problem: Procedure used `opened_dimension_id_country` which doesn't exist in dwh.facts table
  - Solution: Changed to use `dimension_id_country` with `action_comment = 'opened'` filter
  - Files modified:
    - sql/dwh/datamartCountries/datamartCountries_13_createProcedure.sql (lines 993, 1003, 1015, 1027)
  - Affected calculations: applications_used, most_used_application_id, mobile_apps_count, desktop_apps_count
  - Created verification script: sql/dwh/improvements/verify_datamart_calculations.sql
  - Created: ToDo/VERIFICATION_REPORT.md documenting the issue and fix

âœ… **Added New Datamart Columns** - Successfully added 21 new metric columns
  - Created: sql/dwh/improvements/add_new_datamart_columns.sql
  - Status: Columns exist in datamartCountries and datamartUsers tables
  - Note: Columns are empty - need to run ETL update procedure to populate with fixed calculation logic
  - Columns added: resolution metrics, application stats, content quality, community health metrics

### Previous Improvements (from DWH_Improvements_Plan.md):

1. âœ… **Partitioning** - Implemented table partitioning for performance
2. âœ… **Unlimited Hashtags** - Bridge table implemented
3. âœ… **Automation Detection** - Dimension and classification system
4. âœ… **Experience Levels** - User classification system
5. âœ… **Activity Metrics** - Note activity tracking
6. âœ… **Hashtag Metrics** - Specialized hashtag analysis
7. âœ… **Cron Automation** - Automated ETL execution
8. âœ… **Execution Guide** - Simplified workflow documentation

## Next 5 Items to Work On

1. ðŸ”´ Fix failing unit tests
2. ðŸ”´ Verify datamart calculation accuracy
3. ðŸŸ¡ Add resolution time aggregates
4. ðŸŸ¡ Add community health metrics
5. ðŸŸ¡ Add content quality aggregates

## Notes and Decisions

### 2025-01-21
- Created ActionPlan.md based on OSM-Notes-Ingestion structure
- Adopted same priority system (CRITICAL, HIGH, MEDIUM, LOW)
- Identified current test failures that need attention
- Documented missing metrics from dashboard analysis
- Migrated completed tasks from DWH_Improvements_Plan.md
- Documented cancelled tasks with rationale

### Priorities Identified
1. Test stability is critical before adding new features
2. Dashboard metrics are high priority based on user analysis
3. Documentation can be polished while working on features
